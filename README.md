*writer* is a lightweight, browser-friendly markdown service. It's mostly intended to be used as an intermediary/auxillary service (middleware) for some other software components. However, it's not burdensome to also support interactive use in the browser (at least, so far), so why not.

*writer* is a simple and direct combination of python, flask, and markdown2, and supports the full range of markdown syntax. The final HTML-rendered product can be custom styled using CSS.

Some notes about development progress can be found in the ambitiously styled '[release notes](RELEASE.NOTES.md).'

An entry point to [non-project specific content](home.md) is available.

Just completed the addition of an 'export to html' functionality. It's a bit hackish but it works.
