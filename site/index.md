This site was created using my writer software and github's 'github pages' feature. It was pushed from a local repository, the content for which was created with writer.

*writer* is a lightweight, browser-friendly markdown service. It's mostly intended to be used as an intermediary/auxillary service (middleware) for some other software components. However, it's not burdensome to also support interactive use in the browser (at least, so far), so why not.

*writer* is a simple and direct combination of python, flask, and markdown2, and supports the full range of markdown syntax. The final HTML-rendered product can be custom styled using CSS.

An entry point to [blog](home.md) is available. Other things will eventually appear here as well.
